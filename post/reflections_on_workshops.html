                        <p>Last month I did a workshop on text analysis in Python for a new
computational social science group that several of us started at Duke
Sociology (<a
href="https://github.com/devincornell/workshops/tree/master/duke_css_workshop_11-08-21">workshop
materials</a>). As I created the workshop materials, I had two thoughts:
<strong>(1)</strong> most text analysis projects require essentially the
same set of steps. The key is to come up with a system and design
pattern that works for you. <strong>(2)</strong> There aren’t many new
algorithms for text analysis in the social sciences. Most algorithms
we’ve picked up are simply more efficient or slightly different
variations of very old algorithms.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong><em>Most text analysis projects require the same
steps.</em></strong> By this I mean that most projects require the same
or similar boilerplate tasks: preprocessing might involve fixing
spelling issues or removing artifacts from original texts; tokenization
involves some decisions about which tokens to include, how to deal with
named entities, stopword removal, or hyphenation collapsing; document
representation storage involves placing the parsed dataset into a
database (plug for my package doctable), spreadsheet, pickled file, or
some other storage medium that can be accessed. Then an algorithm
operates on those document representations to create models, which are
again stored in a database or other file for creating visualizations or
running statistical models. There may be more aspects to this:
hand-coding, metadata analysis, etc tend to be pretty important - but
the exceptions are rare.</p>
<p>The point of learning these tools is to develop a series of design
patterns. Most of us (speaking to social scientists here) are not
software engineers, nor have we ever even been paid to write code that
someone else will read or use. If we were, we would know that design
patterns in code are all about predictability. Despite the incredibly
large range of possible algorithm designs that could be used, the
software engineer seeks to be consistent: consistent project structure,
consistent design architecture, and even consistent use of syntax for
basics like loops and conditionals. Someone has to read that code, so
the goal is to make it as easily understood as possible. For us, we are
(often) the only ones to read our code. So learning to write research
code is about developing our way of doing the same boilerplate tasks and
organizing projects in a way that we can recognize easily in the
future.</p>
<p><strong><em>There aren’t that many new tools for text analysis in the
social sciences.</em></strong> Let’’’s start with an easy one: Latent
Dirichlet Analysis (LDA). This one algorithm spurred on a (perceived)
revolution of social scientists doing text analysis for interpretation.
It hit everywhere: sociology (see this <a
href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/poetics/vol/41/issue/6">Poetics
special issue</a>), corpus linguistics, and the digital humanities
especially. Right now, Word2Vec is <em>HOT</em>. Same deal, different
algorithm. Now, I’m not against this: in fact, I’ve used both of these
tools in research projects, and I think they can be incredibly useful
and provide important insights. My argument is not that they are not
useful – only that they are not particularly novel in the ways that
social scientists use them.</p>
<p>While LDA has by become by-far the most popular topic modeling
algorithm, it does pretty much the same thing as its matrix
factorization equivalent Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (NMF). They
both start with the same model of the texts: documents are bags of words
represented as rows in a document-term matrix. NMF is similar to
Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) except that it works on matrices with
only positive entries. The thing is, NMF is really old. For whatever
reason, it was LDA that spurred interest in topic modeling for the
social sciences. Same thing goes for word embeddings. While Word2Vec
became hugely possible, subsequent works showed that a simple Pointwise
Mutual Information (PMI) calculation based on word frequency with SVD
could produce results similar to those from Word2Vec, but PMI-SVD has
been around for a really long time. With the exception of parsetree and
named entity extraction, I’m not totally convinced that we’ve seen
anything new that really changes the way we can analyze texts.</p>
<p>If most text analysis pipelines are very similar and we’re using
basically the same tools as we’ve had for the last few decades, where
does that leave text analysis researchers? It leaves us with substance.
The fact that these algorithms are so readily available and we have so
many tools for working with texts means that we can focus less on
methods and more on substantive analyses. In my opinion, the value in
doing computational text analysis is more than the cool factor: we can
answer classical questions that were difficult to answer before. In an
increasingly digital society the study of digital texts has never been
so important. We just have to be willing to ask the right questions
before we pick up new tools.</p>
