# VVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVV

Over the last decade of teaching and reading about data science practices, I have seen a shift in the way that students are learning. Students start learning with tools like Jupyter and RStudio markdown because they allow for quick experimentation and enable near-instant feedback. Expansive packages like Pandas and tidyverse are becoming essential material, and students often engage with them before they even understand the language they are built in (me too, sometimes). There is no doubt that these are powerful and useful tools, but I argue that we should return to the basics if we want to create maintainable data pipelines.
