I have observed that many of my students prefer to learn data science skills by working with tools like Jupyter and RMarkdown notebooks because they give immediate feedback and allow rapid prototyping. As students feel more comfortable with the tools and graduate to larger and more complex projects, these tools become unweildy and new strategies are required for managing codebases. In this article, I discuss strategies for managing larger projects with many objects and complicated relationships.
